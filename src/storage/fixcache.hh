/**
 * The "Fix Cache" contains all the information we know about the relationships between Fix objects, both running
 * and completed.  It can be viewed as a combination of a memoization cache and a dependency graph.
 *
 * The memoization cache is a map from Task to Handle, where the Handle is the result of executing that Task.  The
 * memoization cache can additionally have an entry mapping a Task to std::nullopt, which signals that the Task has
 * already been scheduled but hasn't completed yet.
 *
 * The dependency graph is made up of a multimap from Task to Task, as well as a map from Task to std::size_t.  The
 * former, FixCache.dependency_graph_, associates dependencies with their dependent(s).  Each Task key is associated
 * with an index, allowing one dependency Task to map to many dependent Tasks.  When a running Task completes, all
 * its dependents' blocked counts are updated.  The blocked counts are stored in the second map,
 * FixCache::blocked_count_.  When the blocked count of a Task reaches zero, that Task is "unblocked" and sent back
 * to the scheduler.
