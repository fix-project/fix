/**
 * The primary storage of every fact we discover about a computation.  At least for now, "fact" is defined very
 * narrowly: this cache only stores mappings from Tasks to their results.  For correctness, any "fact" must have the
 * property that it is deterministic and time-invariant; once a fact has been stored in the cache, it will never
 * change.  This cache is effectively append-only; it is impossible to externally remove a result once it has been
 * saved; this may change in the future with the addition of garbage collection, but even so a result should still
 * semantically be immutable.
